# Software defined Storage - Navigating the Brave New World #
## still under construction...

On the 18th October 2018 I presented a session at the TechUG Leeds Event on the subject of Software Defined Storage.
Below are the "further reading" links and resources so that those with an inquiring mind can dig a little deeper.

## General Reading ##

* Software Defined Infrastructure: Why we need it [Link](https://www.google.com) 

* [Software Defined Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_storage), defined as per Wikipedia - always a good place to start

* Sizing a Node in a Software defined storage cluster, what goes into it? [Ceph Example]

* Cross Functional Teams will save us from the Four Horsemen of the IT Ops Apocalypse, [see the article on Newstack.io](https://thenewstack.io/cloud-native-devops-four-horsemen-of-the-operations-apocalypse/), but breaking down the siloes means infrastructure needs to become abstracted and programmable.

## Emerging Technologies ##

* My Fellow TechUG guest presenter Alex Gallagher has put together an [extensive list](https://www.bytesizedalex.com/techug-october-2018/) of resources to accompany his deep dive into the latest hardware technologies in the world of storage
